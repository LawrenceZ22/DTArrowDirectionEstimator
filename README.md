# DTArrowDirectionEstimator
A Distance-transform based arrow direction estimator

As traditional contour-based arrow direction estimators often behave differently when analyzing arrows with contours of 7 sides compared to those with 9 sides. This arrow direction estimator based on distance-transform methods provides a robust arrow direction estimator.

This is one of the research output of **System Design Project 2022-2023** (Group 13), School of Informatics, The University of Edinburgh.
